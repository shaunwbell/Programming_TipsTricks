Section 1: Tools/Software
=========================

Initial Processing
------------------

Basic Processing of raw data is accomplished via SeaBird's SBEDataProcessing software (available only on windows).


Data Archiving and Storage:
---------------------------

With modern storage devices, storage space is not really at a premium.  All data should be stored and archived.  Usually this will include the following:

Seabird data files.  *.XMLCON , *.hex , *.ros
Seabird processed data files.   *.cnv , *.bl *.btl
Initial round of netcdf archiving - *.nc
any associated text files that explain qc steps, offsets or corrections, and basic data information.
